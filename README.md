# File Handling in Java â€“ Task Summary

## Development Environment  
For this task, I used **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** as my development environment.  
VS Code provides a clean interface and useful extensions, such as the **Java Extension Pack**, which helps with writing and debugging Java code.  

## Program Overview  
The program performs basic **file handling operations** in Java, including:  
- Creating a file if it does not already exist  
- Writing to a file by overwriting its content  
- Reading a file and displaying its contents  
- Appending data to an existing file  
- Renaming a file to a new name  
- Deleting a file if it is no longer needed  

To make the program **interactive**, I implemented a **menu-driven system** using a `switch` statement, allowing users to dynamically select operations.  

## Applicability of the Code  
This program can be useful in various real-world scenarios, such as:  
- **Log Management**: Writing and updating log files  
- **Data Storage**: Storing simple text-based records  
- **Configuration Files**: Managing application settings in text files  
- **Basic Notepad Applications**: Creating and modifying text documents  

## What I Learned  
Through this task, I gained practical experience in:  
- **File handling in Java** using `File`, `BufferedReader`, `BufferedWriter`, and `PrintWriter`  
- **Exception handling with IOException** to manage file errors  
- **Using switch statements** to create an interactive menu-based program  
- **Understanding the role of file handling** in real-world applications like logging, data management, and configuration storage  

This task helped me understand how **Java handles files** and how file operations are crucial in software development.
